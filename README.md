# Machine Learning: Decision Tree
A program that creates a decision tree given binary attributes with binary classifications out of a training set.
Uses supervised learning and the ID3 algorithm to generate tree and a greedy post-pruning algorithm to maximize accuracy given a validation set.
Tests accuracy of pre-pruned tree and post-pruned tree given a test set given two heuristics: information gain and variance impurity.
